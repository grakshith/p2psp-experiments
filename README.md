# p2psp-experiments

This repository is aimed at experimenting certain things with the P2PSP protocol.
Currently, the experiment is to run splitters in parallel that transmit the same video stream. The objective is to take advantage of this parallelization among the peers so that latency may be reduced.

## TODO 
Create a new entity called Synchronizer that takes multiple streams from the peer and synchronizes them into one single stream and then feeds the player.
